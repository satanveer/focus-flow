# FocusFlow Production Security Checklist

## ‚úÖ Completed Security Measures

### 1. Environment Variables Security
- [x] **CRITICAL FIX APPLIED**: `.env` file added to `.gitignore` to prevent credential exposure
- [x] `.env.example` file created with placeholder values for setup guidance
- [x] Server-side API keys (APPWRITE_API_KEY) properly separated from client-side config
- [x] Client-side only exposes VITE_ prefixed variables (secure by design)

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- [x] All form inputs properly validated with `.trim()` and length checks
- [x] Email validation using HTML5 `type="email"` and Appwrite validation
- [x] Password minimum length enforcement (8 characters)
- [x] Date validation with past-date detection and user feedback
- [x] Task title validation prevents empty submissions
- [x] Tags properly parsed and filtered with `.filter(Boolean)`

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
- [x] Proper session management through Appwrite
- [x] Protected routes with `ProtectedRoute` component
- [x] User-scoped data access (tasks, notes, settings per user)
- [x] OAuth retry logic with exponential backoff
- [x] Graceful auth error handling and user feedback
- [x] Secure logout with client-side session cleanup

### 4. Error Handling
- [x] Comprehensive ErrorBoundary implementation with dev/prod modes
- [x] Try-catch blocks around async operations
- [x] User-friendly error messages without exposing internals
- [x] Fallback UI states for error conditions
- [x] Proper loading states during async operations

### 5. Data Integrity
- [x] Type safety with TypeScript across all data models
- [x] Appwrite schema validation with required fields and constraints
- [x] Proper data transformation between Appwrite and domain models
- [x] Defensive programming with null checks and fallbacks

## ‚úÖ Accessibility Implementation

### 1. Keyboard Navigation
- [x] Custom focus ring implementation with gradient outline
- [x] Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts in TimerPage (F/S/L/Space)
- [x] Tab trap implementation in modals and popups
- [x] Focus management in dialog components

### 2. Screen Reader Support
- [x] Proper ARIA roles: `role="dialog"`, `role="timer"`, `role="progressbar"`
- [x] ARIA properties: `aria-label`, `aria-live`, `aria-modal`, `aria-valuemin/max/now`
- [x] VisuallyHidden component for screen reader announcements
- [x] Semantic HTML structure with proper headings and labels

### 3. Visual Accessibility
- [x] High contrast mode support with `@media (forced-colors: active)`
- [x] Reduced motion respect with `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`
- [x] Consistent focus indicators across all interactive elements
- [x] Form labels properly associated with inputs
- [x] Color is not the only indicator of state (uses text + icons)

## üîí Production Deployment Checklist

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Set up production environment variables:
  - `VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT`: Production Appwrite URL
  - `VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID`: Production project ID
  - `VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID`: Production database ID
  - Collection IDs for production environment
  - Google OAuth credentials for production domain

### Appwrite Production Setup
- [ ] Create production Appwrite project
- [ ] Set up database collections with proper permissions
- [ ] Configure authentication providers (Email/Password + Google OAuth)
- [ ] Set up domain whitelist for OAuth redirects
- [ ] Enable email verification for production users
- [ ] Set session duration and security policies

### Build & Deployment
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to create optimized production build
- [ ] Verify bundle sizes are acceptable (currently ~336KB main + ~348KB charts)
- [ ] Test production build locally with `npm run preview`
- [ ] Deploy to static hosting (Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare Pages)
- [ ] Configure custom domain and SSL certificate
- [ ] Set up Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

### Performance Validation
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit (target: 90+ scores)
- [ ] Test lazy loading functionality for chart components
- [ ] Verify error boundaries work in production
- [ ] Test offline functionality and service worker (if implemented)

### Security Hardening
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy
- [ ] Set secure HTTP headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data exposed in browser dev tools
- [ ] Test authentication flows thoroughly
- [ ] Validate rate limiting is properly configured in Appwrite

### Monitoring & Analytics
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry/LogRocket)
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring
- [ ] Set up user analytics (privacy-respecting)
- [ ] Create monitoring alerts for API failures

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Zero Trust Input Validation**: All user inputs validated on both client and server
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users can only access their own data
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of error handling and validation
4. **Secure by Default**: Environment variables properly scoped and hidden
5. **Privacy First**: No unnecessary data collection or tracking
6. **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance targeted
7. **Performance Security**: Lazy loading prevents resource exhaustion

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notes for Deployment

1. **Never commit actual `.env` file** - use deployment platform's environment variable settings
2. **Rotate API keys regularly** - especially after any team member changes
3. **Monitor authentication logs** - watch for unusual login patterns
4. **Keep dependencies updated** - run `npm audit` regularly
5. **Use HTTPS everywhere** - no mixed content allowed
6. **Validate OAuth redirect URLs** - prevent open redirect attacks
